# Unity-Python-NeuralNetwork-AI
This is a scene in unity, where 1000 AI spawns, 10 points are looking for a way to the finish line and either reach it or do not reach it.  The AI gets or loses points for the direction, all data is recorded in CSV files. These CSV files can then be processed in a Python script, and then used to train AI using the knut and prin method.
